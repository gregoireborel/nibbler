Snake game playable with 3 different graphic libraries

### What is it?
Nibbler is a video game in which the player controls a snake moving within a plan.The window edges are the limits of the plan. If the snake hits one of these edges, or hits a part of his own body, the game is over.

### Instructions project
The main challenge of this game was to use 3 different graphic libraries. We decided to use the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php), [Qt](http://qt-project.org/) and [Xlib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlib)


### Make it work
This project must be used on a Linux-based environnement, such as Ubuntu or Fedora. You'll need the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php).
